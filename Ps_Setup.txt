	Oscilliscope
	Hotstage
	
General Experiment:
	Record current traces of off channel 1 and 2 from the oscilliscope for some input signal to signal generator at some temperature.
	It would be nice (but not necesary) if you had the option to do it both with and without the hotstage much like it is for dielectric setup 
	
Signal Generator:
	Apply a traingle wave of some frequency at some voltage. 
	There are settings such as Vpp or Vrms, wave "symmetry" and also something called "hi-load" Generally I want Vrms, 50% symmetry and hi load on(?) (not sure about that last one)
	I mostly only use Rigol I guess the others could be added in but this is bonus.

Oscilliscope.
	Need to input the range to be captured and averaging. Timebase and offset, vertical voltage and offset.
	
Hotstage.
	All the options you have for the dielctrics are perfect. 
	Input a series of temepratures either specific or a range or both, cooling/heating rate options and "hold" temperature before measurement. A "go to" is also nice.
	Linkam is fine but Instec would be nice too but if thats a pain you could leave it for me perhaps.
